Karen's Power Tools Newsletter has evolved to breath the rarified aires of silicon

### 2022-11-21 14:48 JMW: Still looking good
lots of enthusiasm ðŸ¦…ðŸ¤™

Dang, I almost forgot: Write a newsletter is part of it.   

I need a landing page to which Karen's Power Tools Newsletter subscribers will be refered upon clicking the teaser link in the email `November's Awesome Issue is free`

I fixed the dates above.  They were all wrong.

Also, I uploaded a video to YouTube:

Sorry about the previous use of punctuation.  We used to use periods at the ends of any string of typed characters

The reason to send the emails before finishing the newsletter text is that I'm using the writing as an excuse not to do the sending, but I won't do the sending until the writing is good enough, but I can't send 40,000 email straight away for technical, political, financial, and ethical reaasons.  I'm limited to sending 500 per day per email account I pay for, so it could take some time.  Therefore, seems to me, the best thing is to get the notifications in the mail while the document they're going to read is improved over time.  The early adopters, those that have supported Karen in the past and/or KarenWare.com during my stint as Acting Karen, would be subjected to the roughest, rawest writing first so that they may witness what they alone have encouraged.  Then, I can slowly improve what one might find until it because the text you are reading at this very moment.  This is the magic of GitHub code responsitory technologies and technology accessories.
